# Demystifying Containers

![logo](logo.png)

This series of blog posts and corresponding talks aims to provide you with a
pragmatic view on containers from a historic perspective. Together we will
discover modern cloud architectures layer by layer, which means we will start at
the Linux Kernel level and end up at writing our own secure cloud native
applications.

Simple examples paired with the historic background will guide you from the
beginning with a minimal Linux environment up to crafting secure containers,
which fit perfectly into todays’ and futures’ orchestration world. In the end it
should be much easier to understand how features within the Linux kernel,
container tools, runtimes, software defined networks and orchestration software
like Kubernetes are designed and how they work under the hood.
